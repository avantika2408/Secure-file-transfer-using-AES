# Secure File Transfer Server using AES Encryption

This project implements a secure file transfer server using AES encryption in GCM mode. It allows clients to securely send files to the server, which are then decrypted and saved. Additionally, clients can send messages to the server for real-time communication.

## Features

- Secure AES encryption (GCM mode) for file transfer
- Real-time progress bar for file transfer
- Multi-client support with concurrent connections
- Basic text messaging between clients and server

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- cryptography library (`pip install cryptography`)
- tqdm library (`pip install tqdm`)
